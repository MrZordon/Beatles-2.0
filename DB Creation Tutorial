Place the php script, createDB.php, into the Exodus folder

start xampp -- make sure you're running as admin

open your web browser up and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin

to run the script you must navigate to the script directly: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/Exodus/createDB.php

the script will run and the wepage will inform you of its status

you can then go back to localhost/phpmyadmin (homepage) and will see the created DB in the lefthand column
